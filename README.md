AsyncImageDownloader
====================

A very simple and light-weight asynchronous image downloader for iOS and Mac OS. 

This library can be installed by either copying the source code into your project, or by using [CocoaPods](http://kylewbanks.com/post/show/AsyncImageDownloader-Published-to-CocoaPods).

For an example on how to use it, have a look at [this blog post](http://kylewbanks.com/post/show/iOS-Async-Image-Downloader).
